== Installation ==

Installing WPtouch Pro is just like any other WordPress plugin, with the addition of a couple extra steps to activate your upgrade & support license.

= WPtouch Pro Minimum Requirements: =

WordPress 3.1 or later (self-hosted installations only)
Administrative access in the WordPress admin to install plugins
PHP 4.4 or later (PHP5 Recommended)
MySQL 4 or later
PHP Safe Mode disabled for saving custom icons, sets and themes

= Uploading the Plugin =

You can upload the plugin 1 of 2 ways, via FTP/SFTP/SSH upload or through the WordPress administration panel.

It is strongly recommended for security, installation speed and reliability that you use the WordPress admin to upload WPtouch Pro.

= Uploading via the WordPress admin panel: = 

1. Visit Plugins->Add New in the admin.
2. Click ‘Upload’ from the horizontal list of options below the page title.
3. Select the location of your wptouch-pro.zip in the file uploader input.
4. Click Upload, and the plugin will be uploaded and installed for you quickly and easily.
5. You will now be asked if you want to activate the plugin, choose yes.

= Uploading via FTP or SSH =

It is assumed for the purposes of this document that if you choose to upload WPtouch Pro via FTP or SSH that you know how to do so, and are comfortable with the process of configuring permissions, etc.

= Directory Name =

WPtouch Pro must be installed in a directory called wptouch-pro off of the main WordPress plugins directory. You will still be able to activate the plugin when it is placed in another directory, but WPtouch will be unable to locate many of the required files, including CSS and Javascript.

= Activating the Plugin =

Activating your WPtouch Pro installation is a two step process.

First, you’ll verify your Account information with us. Second, you’ll add a license for the domain to receive automatic upgrades and support.

= Verify Your Account =

To verify your account credentials, first visit the WPtouch Pro administration page, found in your WordPress install at:

(Left Side Menu) -> WPtouch Pro

When the WPtouch Pro admin page loads, you’ll see a notice banner with a link to begin the activation process: click it.

You’ll now be taken to the account tab, and see two text inputs. Enter your account email address then License Key, and click the ‘Save Changes’ button at the bottom of the form.

When completed and successful, you’ll see a message indicating your next step to activate a license for this domain.

= Activate a License With Your Domain =

Next, click the link regarding activating a site license, and on the license tab you'll see a button to activate a site license: click it.

Your WPtouch Pro installation will confirm a license for the site, and activation will be complete - enjoy WPtouch Pro!
