This Flickr plugin for WordPress will allow you to pull in your Flickr photosets and display them as albums on your WordPress site. 

== Description ==

This plug-in is based on the <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tantan-flickr/'>Flickr Photo Album plugin</a> rewritten. To tie in with another plug-in I (<a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/geo-lightbox/'>geo-lightbox</a>) to write. If you do not use the <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/geo-lightbox/'>geo-lightbox</a> plugin. Please use the <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tantan-flickr/'>Flickr Photo Album plugin</a> plug-in.

This Flickr plugin for WordPress will allow you to pull in your Flickr photosets and display them as albums on your WordPress site. There is a pretty simple template provided which you can customize to 100% match the look and feel of your own site. 

The plugin is customizable in a number of different ways. There are options to allow you to hook it up with a number of different Lightbox-style popup overlay display libraries. Third party commenting services such as Disqus are also supported, allowing your visitors to comment on your photos without hopping over to Flickr.com. A simple Flickr widget is also included to let you easily include your photos into your blog's sidebar.

On the backend, this plugin will add a new Flickr icon to your WordPress edit screen which will allow you to easily insert your Flickr photos and albums into your blog posts with just a couple clicks. You can either have your inserted photos link back to your WordPress Flickr photo album or directly to your Flickr.com photo page.
